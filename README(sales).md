In this project, I have used a Linear Regression Model to predcit the future sales of the products mentioned in the dataset.
In the first step, I have imported the necessary dependencies.
Secondly, I have showed a correlation graph between all the features mentioned
Then data cleaning is done and then the datset is splitted into features and target variable
Then a linear regression model is created, wherein I have passed the training and testing data (80:20) ratio
and finally obtained the data in column form from the yred variable
