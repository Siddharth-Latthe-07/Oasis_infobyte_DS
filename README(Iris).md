In this project, a KNN Classifier is used to predict the an unknown flower into the mentioned categories.
The first phase comes the splitting the dataset into features and target variables. Here, the features include Petal length,Width, Sepal length,width etc and the target included the category of the flower.
Second step includes the splitting of the data into training and testing (ratio is 70:30)
Third step is model creation, KNN classifier has a hyper parameter which predict the output based on it's nearby "K" mentioned features. (default value is 5)
fourth step includes the testing of the model by providing the test data
and the final step is the predictin of the taget variable based on the test data and printing the accuracy score.
